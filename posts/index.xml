It&amp;rsquo;s great at creating connections between notes through backlinks, and many people use it to build personal knowledge bases. Furthermore, its flexibility allows it to be used in many different ways. This post describes how I use Obsidian in my professional life and will hopefully be of interest to others.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="obsidian-for-managers">Obsidian for Managers&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I manage three machine learning engineering teams at a tech company, each working on completely different projects. I need to run stand-ups, attend various meetings with stakeholders, interview candidates, and try to do some hands-on development. I am not an expert in the areas I manage, but I need to have a high-level understanding and be able to provide direction. This means I must constantly learn about many areas, both technical and otherwise, and review what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned. What I need is a way to easily capture information, review it later, and take action. Obsidian is perfect for this purpose.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using LLMs to Evaluate Youtube Videos</title><link>https://yl238.github.io/posts/summarise-youtube-video/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 May 2025 10:50:10 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://yl238.github.io/posts/summarise-youtube-video/</guid><description>&lt;p>I often get recommended YouTube videos with catchy titles but not much substance. To save time, I built a simple app that downloads the transcript of the video, feeds it to ChatGPT, and generates a quick summary, key moments, and any fresh insights the video offers. After skimming this I can decide if the video is worth watching. It’s been a huge time-saver, so I’m sharing the code here, along with a quick overview of how it works.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Create a Static Blog with Hugo, PaperMod and Github Pages</title><link>https://yl238.github.io/posts/hugo-papermod-gh/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 May 2025 20:50:10 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://yl238.github.io/posts/hugo-papermod-gh/</guid><description>&lt;p>This article describes how I built this blog using the &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo&lt;/a> framework and the &lt;a href="https://git.io/hugopapermod">PaperMod&lt;/a> theme; and how to host it on &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages&lt;/a>. Unlike most tutorials, my approach stores the source code in a private GitHub repository while serving the site from a public GitHub Pages repository.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="hugo">Hugo&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo&lt;/a> is a popular open-source static website generator. Written in Go, it is very fast to build and serve. Like Jekyll, you can write the blog posts using Markdown and Hugo will natively render the markdown files to HTML pages. It supports many themes, including PaperMod, which is very flexible and pleasing to look at.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Time Series Forecasting Methods (Part 1): Exponential Smoothing and ARIMA</title><link>https://yl238.github.io/posts/exp-smoothing-arima/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 May 2025 14:29:53 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://yl238.github.io/posts/exp-smoothing-arima/</guid><description>&lt;p>Time series forecasting refers to the use of historical data to predict future values, and enabling the identification of patterns and trends that inform decision-making. An example time series is the UK Retail Sales Index for electrical household appliances from 1988 to 2025 (Figure 1), which provides seasonally adjusted retail sales in Great Britain in both value and volume terms. The ability to accurately forecast such data is crucial, as it helps business stakeholders and policymakers make well-informed decisions in scenarios such as setting economic policies, managing inventory or planning staffing requirements.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Edinburgh Data Science Meetup</title><link>https://yl238.github.io/posts/edinburgh-data-science/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 15:49:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://yl238.github.io/posts/edinburgh-data-science/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently I gave a presentation at the &lt;a href="https://www.meetup.com/edinburgh-data-science-ai/">Edinburgh Data Science Meetup&lt;/a> on time-series forecasting. In particular, comparing the differences between traditional methods such as ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing with the latest Deep Learning models. Hopefully I will turn these into blog posts in the coming months, but in the meantime you can download the presentation here.&lt;/p>
